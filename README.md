# Time series forecasting using PyTorch and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

Time series forecasting plays a major role in data analysis, 
with applications ranging from anticipating stock market trends to forecasting weather patterns.
Iâ€™ll uncover the critical preprocessing procedures that underpin the accuracy of forecasts along the way.

### Numpy for working with arrays

### Pandas for working with relational or labeled data

### Matplotlib for data visualization

### Seaborn for data visualization

### DateTime to work with data and time

### MinMaxScaler for normalization

### PyTorch to build the neural network for training

### Dataset:
Here I use Yahoo Finance to get the share market dataset
